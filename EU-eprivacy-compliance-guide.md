### Cookies, Marketing, Tracking & Consent — A Practical Compliance Guide

> Designed for **businesses, tech teams, compliance professionals, and founders** operating in or targeting the EU.

## 1 What Is the ePrivacy Directive?

The **ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC)** complements GDPR and specifically regulates:

- Electronic communications  
- Cookies and tracking technologies  
- Online marketing communications  
- Confidentiality of communications  

--> **Important:**  
Unlike GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive is a **Directive**, not a Regulation.  
This means **each EU country implements it through national law**, which can lead to slight differences.

## 2 How ePrivacy and GDPR Work Together

| Aspect | GDPR | ePrivacy Directive |
|------|------|-------------------|
| Scope | All personal data | Electronic communications & tracking |
| Legal Nature | Regulation (directly applicable) | Directive (national laws) |
| Focus | Lawful processing of data | Consent, cookies, marketing |
| Relationship | General law | Sector-specific (overrides GDPR where applicable) |

--> **Rule of thumb:**  
If ePrivacy applies → **follow ePrivacy first**, then GDPR.
