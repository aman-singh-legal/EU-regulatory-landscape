# 2. REGULATIONS vs DIRECTIVES — How EU Law Works

## **2.1 EU Regulations**
- Apply **directly** in all EU Member States.  
- No national law required; binding immediately.  
- Ideal for harmonizing digital/tech laws.

### Examples:
- **GDPR** (Data Protection)  
- **DSA** (Digital Services Act)  
- **DMA** (Digital Markets Act)  
- **AI Act**

 Companies operating in EU must follow them instantly.

---

## **2.2 EU Directives**
- Set **goals**, but each Member State decides *how* to achieve them.  
- Must be transposed into national law.  
- Creates slight cross-country differences.

### Examples:
- **NIS2** (Cybersecurity)  
- **Whistleblower Directive**  
- **ePrivacy Directive**

 Compliance requires checking *both* EU Directive + local implementation.
